Qubes
=====

Starting
--------

When starting with Qubes as a computer worked with a highly tuned setup for
personal preferences in usability installing Qubes is like droping anchor. The
cost of security is you can't do simpliest things anymore. Even if wanted.
Point is to find out how to tell the system the difference of wanted and not so
much wanted stuff without loosing the benefits of Qubes in a convinient
way.

On top you loose performance. Qubes generates a stead cpu usage of 20-30% (of
400%) without anything important running (having a audio control like
pavucontrol running in dom0 adds another 20% or so).

Staying productive
------------------

The only way to keep going was a double boot with all data for me. This is not
a secure setup but a learning constelation.

Qubes has an single image for all persistent stuff of a VM called
"private". This one has to be avaiable in Qubes and pure Debian to have
a double boot with all data in $HOME. The layout is a bit different as
it contains other persistent data as well:

```
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 Dec  9 13:58 /rw/bind-dirs
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 Feb 17 19:17 /rw/config
drwxr-xr-x  5 root root  4096 Feb  8 15:28 /rw/home
drwx------  2 root root 16384 Oct  6 14:26 /rw/lost+found
drwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 Feb  8 15:28 /rw/usrlocal
```

The user in Qubes has to have uid 1000, gid 1000 and name user. The last
i did just with a symlink to have a `home/user`. Qubes does to a symlink
from /home but uses bind mount. I established the same in Debian with
this entry in `/etc/fstab`:

```
/rw/home        /home       none    noauto,bind,defaults 0 0
```

The Qubes Manage nicely shows where
the disk images for the VMs ended up so i created a Debian AppVM, removed the
private raw image of it and symlinked the partition.

I added the part to boot Qubes from the original Qubes installtion into
the grub config of my pure Debian installation to have a double boot.

Backup
------

There is no usable backup concept. Raw blobs take too long to be
regulary made (once a day?). Due to the separation the fine tuning of
the system is scattered into to many places. A restauration of the same
system after a crash or lost will takes more or less the same time as
the initial setup. Backup of changes of a huge bunch of files will be a
nightmare (my valuable /rw data is currently around 300GB). A
incremental backup including a backup of all individual configuration is
urgently needed.

In a typical unix setup you tend to do all individual setup changes in
$HOME and keep a backup of that. A restauration of it is easy, you
install a system around and restore the $HOME into it and are done.

In Qubes you start putting individual setup into the system because you
tune your templates. Any AppVM using that template benefits from your
personal settings. This complicates things because beside having several
$HOMEs you have different place for you individual tunings mixed into
the system as well.

Template usage
--------------

I played around with VMs alot. This is much fun, it just works. You can
clone, rename, delete VMs at will, the AppVMs depend on templates which
can even be changed easily. All installed software is in the template
and inherited by the AppVM.

This leads to several usability problems:

- if you need to install a missing program you do so in the template and
  have to restart both after that

- if you have several AppVMs with dedicated duties and thus different
  needs for different programs you end up either in a single template
  that has installed all the software for all duties or in several
  templates with alot additional administrative work

so my rules with VMs are as such:

- i do not touch the preinstalled templates but clone those before
  change and reduce the installed packages in that template to the bare
  minumum

- i cloned the minimal template into several templates with different
  purposes - in case i find a package missing in all templates i install
  it from dom0 via a script.

during minimize i found really weird packages installed in Debian
templates (i did not check fedora):

- all xorg drivers while only 2 are needed

- wpa while there is no wlan in the AppVM

- firmware

- big fat NetworkManager, isc-dhcp, avahi, mdns (i replaced it
  succesfully by dhcpcd&dnsmasq)

USB
---

Some chips have a reset-bug. This was my major show stopper in using
USB. Next it was completly unclear to me what to expect from Qubes about
it. The sys-usb VM was not installed and when i did so it hang so i left
all USB in dom0 which is a bad idea.

The reset bug is bad but having USB in dom0 is worse i decided. So i
enabled to be not so strict in that VM and it works.

After that you can (via command line currently only) ex/import most of the
USB devices to VMs, device by device, not devices by bus anymore. Just
issue a

```
qvm-usb -l
qvm-usb -a <id> <vm>
```

to do so.

### Mouse

A mouse was automatically detected and grabbed by dom0 after i agreed
to it when logging in.

### Webcam

A webcam could be exported to an AppVM and use in there with not problems.

### Android debug bridge

I did not get ADB to work.

### USB Ether

I love USB Ether as my android does that for tethering. Using it i'm not forced
to open a maybe vulnerable WLAN. The sys-usb recognizes the device but i found
no way to export it to the sys-net where it could be used.

Wireless
--------

My bluetooth was switched on all the time (led was lit). This wasn't the
case under Debian. i installed rfkill `qubes-dom0-update rfkill` in
dom0 which allowed to switch wwan & bluetooth off. Even after reboot the
devices was now switched off by default.

Sound
-----

Sound is done via pulseaudio. Each VM gets an artificial sink
(pulseaudio speach) which is sending all sound to dom0. In dom0 a
pulseaudio mixes everything together et voila.

Newer Debian (and fedora) switched to pulseaudio 10 while the packages
are packaged for 9. The .so works but is in the wrong place. Just
symlink it to activate and restart the daemon or reboot the VM.

```
ln -s \
	../../pulse-9.0/modules/module-vchan-sink.so \
	/usr/lib/pulse-10.0/modules/module-vchan-sink.so
```

Observation: the volume control pavucontrol in dom0 takes around 20%
cpu.

Video
-----

As already mentioned: Qubes eats some CPU. On top it separates the
processes doing GUI output. So any AppVM has to get the content to dom0
through some channel. This is (with my HW, a Lenovo T420s) not good
enough: Movies played with `mpv` stutter, `vlc` seems to do a better
job. At least the audio is not interrupted.

I was not able to play DVDs, error was


```
libdvdread: Attempting to retrieve all CSS keys
libdvdread: This can take a _long_ time, please be patient

libdvdread: Get key for /VIDEO_TS/VIDEO_TS.VOB at 0x00010f60

[...]
[dvdnav] Error getting next block from DVD 1 (Error reading from DVD.)
[lavf] av_find_stream_info() failed
Failed to recognize file format.
```

while `libdvdcss` is installed.

Voidlinux
---------

I recently discovered Voidlinux, a new distribution from scratch without
legacy issues. So i decided to try to build a Voidlinux based AppVM.

A setup of an HVM was braindead simple. An AppVM (or PVM) would be
harder. All the Qubes programs have to be build. This is alot of trouble
because these are targeted for the support distributions only. The repos
contain a mix of building and packaging (for rpm & deb). I expect a
source tree to build with `make` and to install with `make install` -
plus maybe a configure step in the beginning. These repos don't behave
like that. Some just give a help when issueing a `make`, some have even
bugs in that help, some don't even have a generic Makefile and rely on
distro specific stuff, some install plain files with executable bit.

On top the packages depend on systemd (which is not used by Voidlinux).
I doubt that systemd is a good choice for a system like Qubes but that's
another matter. Anyway the packages need some cleanup before being
generic enough and usabe.


VPNs
----

This is pure Qubes marketing: VPNs are incredible and a major argument
to use Qubes. I now can have several VPNs up, one in each VM and work in
completly different environments. I can switch only by focussing the
window. Each has it's own network setup. No more to say - it (as
expected) just works! Neat!

X11 startup phase in VMs
------------------------

### i3

I switched to i3 recently and was happy that it's support in Qubes. It
is a bit tuned to allow colored titlebars but the config is mainly
standard. I mainly followed the instructions in
[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/i3/] and after logout you could choose the
different windowmanager in the dm.

Qubes brings an home grown i3status which i did not like so i
implemented one myself (see [qubes-i3status] and [qubes-i3status.py], i
use two scripts mainly for debugging so it's easier to implement new
formats and features). I put the files into `/usr/local/bin/` and
adapted the i3 config accordingly.

While `dmenu_run` would run fine it only runs programs from dom0. Qubes
preinstalls `i3-dmenu-desktop` which gives access to the desktop
startfles and thus access to start programms in AppVMs.

### xresources

in case you set xresources these must be set per VM as each VM has an
own X11 server running.

### xmodmap

If you happen to use a modified xmodmap (as i do) you have to apply
these in each VM. It must be run at startup (see above).

### Clipboard

The clipboard drives me crazy, all VMs are separated and the content is
not propagated by design. This is an incredible feature which hit me
hard. I never type out, i always copy & paste. always. Now i have to
learn to press additional Ctrl-Shift-C & V. But sometimes even that does
not work as X has several clipboards.

There is a nice program called `autocutsel` which solved most of my
problems. Point is: It has to be run in each VM at startup (see above).
I use two of these:

```
autocutsel -f
autocutsel -f -s PRIMARY
```

### Mouse hide

Some programs switch off the mouse cursor while not in use which is usefull for
slideshows, videowatching or even the terminal. This doesn't seem to be
supported by Qubes and the cursor is just hang about everywhere.

### Urgency flag

Programs can set the urgency flag to drag the users attantion. This is not
support by Qubes and messenger programs or emailer can't inform the user of new
events.

Unnecessary complexity
----------------------

I can not follow some decisions for pre-installed or dependend software.
Qubes seems to have the attitude of "Qubes is secure so we do not care
too much what's going on in VMs". So the VMs itself are not much
hardened or even cleaned up. Many packages are installed that are
unnessesary or even dangerous. But some major decisions attracted my
attention. This is a list.

### systemd

systemd is a huge moloch merging many functionality into one single
something. I consider this a non-unix aproach. Out of security
perspective i would argue that so much code contains more attach
surface. Why not using a small simple startup system like runit?

### exim

exim is not as complex as system but bears features that you seldomly
really need. The project opensmtp concentrates on the important parts.

### qt

qt is a monster. Full of minor bugs and features. I would not use it
in the most critical VM dom0. gtk isn't much better. I agree, this is
all about gui, eye candy attaches attention but i would not install qt
in dom0.

### NetworkManage

The network in AppVMs rely on NetworkManage! Even avahi and mdns is
preinstalled. This ist completly useless, a simple dhcp-client would do
(dhcpcd was my decision which works fine in debian-9).

File exchange
-------------

I was missing a method to make files and directory trees from on VM
visible in another VM. So i developed
(Qubes-InterVMFS)[https://github.com/emdete/Qubes-InterVMFS] which makes
exactly that possible.

Outstanding issues
------------------

- GUI error with debian-9 (U2MFN_GET_MFN_FOR_PAGE: get_user_pages
  failed, ret=0xfffffffffffffff2)

- acpi (?) problem (battery control, XF86Launch1, brightness sometimes
  stop working after suspend/resume)

- Qubes vm manager does not provide scrollbars and the windowsize is
  fixed. in case there are more VMs than screenheight you can't access
  those.

- templates do not shut down

- how to change pwd (account, crypt fs)

- separate packing for distributions from code

- Debian should switch off apt install-recommends, install-suggests

- are the dependencies correct?

- traces left from dispvm

- sudo-install into /usr/local/bin could overwrite programs permanently
  if that's first in $PATH

- shutdown takes ages
